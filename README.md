# LLM4-reward-shaping

folders:
assets: cube used for this task
configs: configuration files for the training and experiment
output: results and logs generated from the experiments(due to the size of the output, only keep one model)
ppo: implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm for training
prompts: prompt files used for the input of the LLM


files:
deploy.py: script for deploying the trained model
LLMloop.py: main script for generating rewards using LLM
stage1.py: script for stage 1, which is sampling 50,000 initial poses for stage 2, the pool of initial pose is in public_allegro_grasp_50k_s1_2contacts.npy
stage2.py: script for stage 2, which is training the Simple RL policy using PPO
test.py: script for testing the trained model, test the performance of the reward generated by LLM
